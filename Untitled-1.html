    <p class="buh" style="position: relative;">The Genshin Impact 3.2 trailer
        ‘Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises’ shows off both Scara and Nahida in action,
        along with new events and weapons that players can expect to come across in the next update,
    </p>
    <p class="buh" style="position: relative;">
        Layla is a Cryo character, though we don’t know much about her, she has been described as “Half-Awake, Half-Asleep, All Incredulous”.
        It looks like Layla’s abilities have leaked on Honey Hunter, giving us a good idea as to what her best build looks like.
    </p>
    <p class="buh" style="position: relative;">
        The next character comes as no surprise, the Lesser Lord Kusanali, otherwise known as the Dendro Archon and Nahida.
        We’ve been expecting the Dendro Archon to make an appearance since 3.0, but all signs point to her joining the game in 3.2

    SCARAMOUCHE
</p>
<p class="buh" style="text-align: justify;position: relative;">
    Beating Scaramouche and claiming rewards nets you the usual stuff, like Ascension Gems, Artifacts, and a chance for Midlander Billets.
    Notably, he rewards the talent ascension materials Puppet Strings, Mirror of Mushin, and Daka’s Bell. As of this writing, only Nahida uses his materials.
    In both phases, you’ll want to use the Neo Akasha Terminal that Nahida provides you in the story to beat him.
    Throughout the fight, energy cores will drop on the ground. Picking them up will power up the Neo Akasha Terminal. And he's have
    2 Phase that you can fight like "Signora" or 3 phase like "Childe"
</p>
<p class="buh" style="text-align: justify; position: relative;">
    recommend bringing a Pyro or Cryo character, as well as a bow-user for this fight.
    Leave your Electro characters behind, as he has high resistance to Electro damage.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: white; font-size: 50; font-family: Arial; text-shadow: 0 0 10px #a27ec4;">
    PHASE ONE
    <p class="buh" style="position: relative; text-align: justify;">
        This part of the fight isn’t too hard. You can just keep beating on the boss, ignoring most mechanics if your party is leveled up enough .
        If your party is struggling and taking tons of damage, make sure to use the Neo Akasha Terminal to clear the elemental effects off the ground and power yourself up.
        You can do this by activating it while standing on the elemental matrixes on the ground
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center; color: white; font-size: 50; font-family: Arial; text-shadow: 0 0 10px #a27ec4;">
    PHASE TWO
    </p>
    <p class="buh" style="position: relative; text-align: justify; ">
        You can waste your time hammering your strongest attacks at the boss, but honestly, you should just use the Neo Akasha Terminal as much as you can. As the energy cores appear, Four-Leaf Sigils will also appear above them, which you can use to quickly zip around the battlefield.
        Once you pick up enough energy to power the Neo Akasha Terminal, blast away the boss’s shield with it, while keeping in mind to dodge attacks.
        After his shield breaks, Scaramouche will fly up, becoming unreachable, and four Nirvana Engines will spawn in the center.
    </p>
    <p class="buh" style="position: static;text-align: justify; ">
        Quickly break these (they’re weakest to Cryo, Dendro, and Pyro) to get more energy for the Neo Akasha Terminal. Use it to blast him above you; otherwise, he will one-shot kill your active party member.
        We had a hard time hitting the floating engines with our team (Diluc, Kazuha, Xinqiu, and Bennett). Kazuha was able to destroy them with his elemental skill, but due to cooldowns, he couldn’t kill them fast enough.
    </p>
    <P class="buh" style="position: relative; text-align: justify;">
        This is why we recommend bringing a bow-user character to help hit the floating ones quickly.
        If you successfully hit him, he’ll fall and become paralyzed, allowing you to get some big damage in. Sure enough, you should be able to take him down.
        You can keep using the Neo Akasha Terminal when his shield is down to deplete massive amounts of his health at once.
    </P>
